Problem Description :

In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that we leave at least one urinal free between us and 
the next person peeing. For example, if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, we will 
choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the 
same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first-person pees into urinal 2 or 4). 

We need to implement a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule. 

To execute the program:
1. Run the main() in urinals.java
2. Provide the path where the urinal.dat exists


To execute all test cases in one go:
1. Run the complete set of tests using urinalsTest class in urinalsTest.java file


To execute individual test case:
1. Run individual test case by running each function in urinalsTest.java
